Aera_Simulation

This is a simulation of a fictional floating island, Aera in the middle of blue sky and clouds. The island has no modern instituitions(hospitals). 

How the island works:

FARMING
1. The food is produced through farming. Everyone over the age of 11 works in the fields to produce food.
2. Each person consumes one unit of food each month. In case of food scarcity, people die due to famine. All excess food is stored for the next year.

POPULATION GROWTH
1. Women can get pregnant between the age of 16 to 35.
2. Every year, one in five women will become pregnant. This means each woman has 20% chance of becoming pregnant.
3. The likelihood of birthing a girl and a boy is equal.
4. There's 25% chance of miscarriage.

Assumptions: 
1. All “able” people, that is, anyone over 12 years old, works in the fields to produce food. This includes both men and women for simplicity.
2. A certain number of women in the fertility band give birth to babies every year.
3. Anyone over sixty years old dies.
